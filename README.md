This dataset contains detailed event‐level records from a simulated inpatient admission and bed-allocation process in an acute-care hospital. Each row represents a single patient episode and traces the patient trajectory from arrival to discharge, including queueing delays for bed assignment. The key attributes are: ID (unique patient identifier), Entme (time of arrival to the hospital system in hours), LOS (length of stay parameter used in the simulation model), ExTme (expected or scheduled discharge time), EntmAtQueStrt (time at which the patient joins the bed queue), LOS in Hospital (Hrs) (total time spent in the hospital system), LOS in BED (Hrs) (time actually occupying a bed), and Waiting Time (Hrs) for getting BED (pre-admission delay while waiting for a bed). All time-related variables are expressed in hours with high-resolution floating-point values, enabling fine-grained temporal analysis.

Preparation: 
The dataset was generated using a discrete-event simulation framework for hospital flow analysis. Arrival times and length-of-stay distributions are calibrated to realistic patterns of medical-surgical inpatients, including early arrivals, delayed bed assignment, and variability in discharge times. Because the data are fully synthetic and do not contain any protected health information, they can be freely used for methodological development, benchmarking, and educational purposes without privacy concerns. The data are stored in tabular format (e.g., CSV or Excel), which facilitates direct integration with common analytics tools such as Python, R, MATLAB, and spreadsheet software.

Practical Application: 
The intended use of this dataset is to support research and development in healthcare operations, hospital capacity planning, and predictive analytics. Typical applications include: (i) queueing and congestion analysis for inpatient units; (ii) bed management and admission scheduling policies; (iii) estimation and prediction of length of stay and bed occupancy; (iv) evaluation of emergency department boarding times and their impact on downstream units; and (v) what-if experiments on scenarios such as increased demand, reduced bed capacity, or alternative discharge policies. Because the dataset provides both arrival times and resource-usage intervals, it is suitable for validating simulation models, testing optimization algorithms, and comparing heuristic vs. data-driven decision rules.
From a data science perspective, the attributes can be used to build supervised learning models that predict waiting time for beds, total hospital LOS, or risk of extended stay, given early information about arrival time and preliminary LOS estimates. Researchers can explore regression, survival analysis, or time-series models, while operations researchers can embed these predictions into simulation-optimization and digital-twin frameworks. The dataset is also appropriate for teaching courses in healthcare systems engineering, simulation, stochastic processes, and machine learning, where students can replicate key performance indicators such as bed occupancy rate, average waiting time, and throughput.
Future opportunities include extending the dataset with additional attributes (e.g., patient acuity, service type, or priority class), coupling it with cost metrics to perform economic evaluation, and integrating it into larger multi-ward or hospital network models. Overall, this dataset provides a flexible and reproducible testbed for advancing research on resilient and efficient hospital bed-management strategies.
